/*
Time Complexity:

The algorithm explores two possible moves at each step: down (i+1) and right (j+1).
At each step, it makes two recursive calls to explore these moves.
In the worst-case scenario, the algorithm explores all possible paths from the starting point (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (n-1, m-1) of the grid.
Since at each step, there are two recursive calls made, and the grid is of size n Ã— m, the total number of function calls will be 2^(n+m).
Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(2^(n+m)).

Space Complexity:

The space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of recursion, which is limited by the size of the grid.
In the worst-case scenario, the maximum depth of recursion will be n+m-1 when the algorithm traverses either all rows or all columns to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.
Therefore, the space complexity of the algorithm is O(n+m).
